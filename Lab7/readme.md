## Executive Summary 
Week seven discussed the object oriented programming and allowed the practice of creating and diagramming software.
In addition gave the opportunity to practice working with files, folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compressing.

## File Compression
File comprression went over the purpose of file compression and compression and file size.

### Purpose of File Compression
Data compression purpose is the  method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space
for easier and faster transmission over a network or internet. 

### Compression and File Size
SVG file was 8kb when compressed it became 2kb. The file compression reduced it by 6kb. 
If the file was a jpg files- jpg have compression feature so you may not achieve improved results when zipping these files.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
Python focuses on creating reusable patterns of code, in contrast to procedural programming, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions.
The shark class is an example of this by the pattern code used.

### Attributes:
In the shark example the  Shark object sammy is using the two methods swim() and be_awesome(). We called these using the dot operator (.), which is used to reference an attribute of the object. The attribute is a method and it’s noted with parentheses, like how you would also call with a function.

### Methods:
This is type of function that are defined within a class. In the shark example they are swimming and being awesome,
these are easily identified because self in the function of these arguments which is a reference to objects based on this class.

### Constructor:
Constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

### Class vs. Object
Class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. It defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object 
that is instantiated from this class. Therefore object is an instance of a class. 
In the shark example it is  the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program. 
The two are used to create patterns and then make use of the patterns.To instantiate an object means the same thing as creating an object.

## Object Oriented Concepts
see below

### Instantiated Objects
To instantiate an object means the same thing as creating an object.
In the shark example there are codes that have “init” in them i.e. self, name and age.

### Inheritance
In the shark example they are swim and be awesome, this is the  mechanism of making new classes from existing ones. 

### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data together. In addition hiding them from the outside world and abstraction
is the behavior of the real world. In the shark example it is when the students name and age are bound together.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
The UML was used in the class method that defined two functions one for swimming and one for awesome.

## Conclusion
Week seven was very interesing because it discussed the object oriented programming and allowed the practice of creating and diagramming software.
In addition it  gave the opportunity to practice working with files, folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compressing.
