## Executive Summary 
Week seven discussed the object oriented programming and allowed the practice of creating and diagramming software.
In addition gave the opportunity to practice working with files, folders and exploring the impact of file/folder compressing.

## File Compression
File comprression went over the purpose of file compression and compression and file size.

### Purpose of File Compression
Data compression purpose is the  method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space
for easier and faster transmission over a network or internet. 

### Compression and File Size
SVG file was 8kb when compressed it became 2kb. The file compression reduced it by 6kb. 
If the file was a jpg files- jpg have compression feature so you may not achieve improved results when zipping these files.
